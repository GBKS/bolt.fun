        "question":"What is Shock the Web?",
        "answer":"Shock the Web is a virtual hackathon to promote, explore, build and design web applications that can interact with WebLN enabled wallets and browsers. We want to make building on bitcoin more accessible to the masses of web developers out there. <br/><br/> Bitcoin development can seem scary for new developers coming in, but it doesn't have to be. With the lightning network's toolkit and libraries a bunch of new opportunities are waiting to be explored. We hope these hackathons can be a chance for you to preview what is possible on bitcoin and the lightning network by fostering collaboration, hopefully shortening (or easing) any developer onboarding time, and helping you connect with other bitcoiners in a fun and friendly space."

        "question":"When and where will it take place? ",
        "answer":"The hackathon will be held online, and will take place between March 22nd (Tuesday) - 28th (Monday). Workshops, talks, and comminity engagement events will take place between 3pm - 8 pm UTC."
    },{
        "question":"What will we be doing?",
        "answer":"During the hackathon we'll have be a bunch of guided sprint modules and sessions, talks and lectures, as well as ongoing mentorship from some friendly bitcoiner developers and designers to help you make your app or prototype. <br/><br/ Taking part in these events are optional (apart from the opening and closing ceremony), if you’d like to show your face at the beginning and end and hack straight away for 6 days be our guest. But if you’d like to join in on the extras, we’d love to see you there."
    },{
        "question":"Who can take part?",
        "answer":"Anyone! Hackathons are often very developer focused, and design is often left to one side. However, great products or experiences require this gap to be bridged. It's time to get designers and developers on the same team so we can create fun and cool new products. <br/><br/ >We’d love to involve anyone that wants to take part: designers, developers, PMs, consultants, noobs! Everyone is welcome."
    },{
        "question":"How many members can I have on my team?",
        "answer":"Teams can be between 1-5 members. Try to structure your team so that you have a variety of skill sets. If you’d like to find people for your team, or join an existing one, you can request for that in your registration form and we’ll try to pair you with a good team match. "
    },{
        "question":"Who will choose the winners?",
        "answer":"Our panel of judges will asses the final products (or prototypes) on the final afternoon. They will decide on a 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place. <br/><br/> There will also be a community choice award - this is the project that receives the most amount of tips on makers.bolt.fun between the evening of the penultimate day and the final ceremony (24hr period). This will be chosen by you, the community!"
